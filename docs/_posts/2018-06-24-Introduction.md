In this tutorial we will code from scratch some of the basic concepts that are needed for a working cryptocurrency. The angle is always to implement things in the most simplest way.

The project that we will build in this tutorial is called “Nell-MDCoins”. The programming language is Python. The NELL-MDCoins is a project started out as a research project. But I hope of making this the official cryptocurrency for NELL Inc. So, that means , this would be a very big tutorial untill we take it to the point , where it can be a production ready cryptocurrency like bitcoin.

The final version of NELL-MDcoins is hoped to be a “production ready” implementation of a cryptocurrency, but it the design of such complex project takes time. So, I want you to embark on this journey with me. Where we will see the growth of a new cryptocurrency like bitcoin.

Now, all this time , I have been saying , a crypto-currency like bitcoin, but at its core , it is extremely different cryptocurrency. What's different in this crypto-currency ? . You will find in upcoming chapters. So Stay tuned .

There is also a Javascript implementation of the project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/justdvnsh/nell-mdcoins-js). However, this tutorial would be based on the python implementation. However, if you are a javscript developer , you can read about the concepts here , and then look at the source code of the cryptocurrency in Javascript. 

__Now , why I choose python and javascript as the main languages of the project ?__ Actually there is a reason , behind it. Find out the reasons, in the upcoming chapters.

Now , before starting , I would like to give some pre-requisites.

<div class="message">
    This is not a python tutorial. We expect, that you know atleast basic python to understand the code. If you are not a programmer , and just wanting to learn about the blockchain system, then the pre-requisite does not apply to you.
